## Disaster Impact and panic movement Prediction
The Past records of Natural disaster related casualities show that the maximum loss of human lives is not caused by the lack of precious rescue resources but as a result of their inefficient utilization.Large number of lives can be saved if timely medical aid is provided to survivors.
Prediction of a future disaster seems to be a good way to save lives by evacuating people from places of high threat level to safer places beforehand, but this way of managing disasters has its own limitations because time between predicting a disaster with high accuracy and when the disaster strikes is usually not sufficient to carry out evacuation at a large scale.
We focus on to develop effective resource deployment system by predicting panic movement of people and the level of impact of disaster in different geographical locations for earthquake and flood .

### Earthquake
It is not feasible to predict earthquakes and evacuate people into safer zones as the earthquakes cannot be predicted with high accuracy with sufficient time in hand for evacuation. We aim to predict the areas most susceptible to loss of life and property caused by the earthquake based on the parameters such as population density,age and dimension of buildings in a locality,building concentration and studying the past impact records,etc.Based on the impact prediction and population density we will channel rescue resources. 

### Flood
It is possible as well as feasible to predict (or simulate) the progress of the flood using terrain,topology,live weather data,amount of rainfall recieved to mark places to be safe or unsafe. We can also predict the panic movement of people during the flood using usual GPS records patterns and intensity of disaster.Finally we can combine the panic movement and safe/unsafe prediction of different geographical locations in order to plan out rescue operations.
